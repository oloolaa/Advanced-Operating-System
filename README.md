# Programming Projects for Advanced-Operating-System by Yinglue

## Description
This repository is for the two programming projects in AOS course. Project 1 is the implementation of Chandy and Lamportâ€™s protocol based on MAP protocol.
```
MAP protocol is defined as a way to collect each node's state, and initiator can detect whether MAP protocol is terminated or not.
```
Project 2 is the implementation of Lamport's protocol.

## To run the program
Since the program should be initiated at the same time, a bash script is needed for the start of the program.

## After the run test
Start the clean process by using cleanup script.
```
>> ./cleanall.sh
```
