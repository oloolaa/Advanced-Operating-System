INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE PROGRAM :

1. Extract the submitted zip file.

2. Config file, java files, and java class files should be in the same directory called "Project1".

3. The path for "Project1" should be "/home/012/y/yx/yxc180006/Project1".

4. In my application, I can't set up the script correctly. So the way to run the program would be input command in the terminal:
   >> java Main <config file name> <node-id>
   By doing this, the program will start running.

   For example: >> java Main config.txt 0
   
5. The output files "<configFilename>-<nodeId>.out" files will be generated in the current working directory.
